90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Original Masaha book ids: 3164-3180.
    PV converted the text from epub and moved page numbers to the end of the
    page.
    PV tagged editorial sections (some volumes contain introductions by the
    author's
    son, which have been tagged as editorial; introductions by the author
    himself
    are not tagged as editorial).
    In vol. 13, PV added subsections for the letters ghayn to yā'
    between pointed brackets `<>`
    (in all other volumes, these subsections were already present,
    between double pointed brackets `«»`).
    The order of the annotated volumes is the order of the edition
    (chronological, from the 4th to the 14th C AH);
    the author himself seems to have had another order in mind:
    - vols. 13-16 in this edition,
    titled "Nuqabā' al-bashar fī al-qarn al-rābiʿ ʿashar",
    the author calls al-juz' al-awwal min mawsūʿatinā
    (see, for example, PageV15P1277)
    - vols. 10-12 in this edition,
    titled "al-Kirām al-barara fī al-qarn al-thālith baʿd al-ʿashara"
    the author calls al-juz' al-thānī min mawsūʿatinā
    (see, for example, PageV10P453)
    (see also the editor's introduction, PageV01P017)
    No attempt has been made to reflect this original (?) order in the annotated
    text.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Editorial removed. Poetry tagged. 2- I changed the
    third-level headers for name entries into biographical tags since the main theme
    of the book is biographical and most of the entries include biographical
    information. In the first volume, this biographical information is limited to
    the transmitters and the transmittees of the person in question, and the sources
    of his biography. From the second volume onwards, it also includes information
    about birth and death place/date, the students and teachers and the titles of
    his books. 3- I tagged the unnumbered entries in vol 10 onwards with an asterisk
    (### $ *). 4- Cross-references have not been automatically tagged and have no
    clear marks. The only way to tag them is to read the whole text.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
