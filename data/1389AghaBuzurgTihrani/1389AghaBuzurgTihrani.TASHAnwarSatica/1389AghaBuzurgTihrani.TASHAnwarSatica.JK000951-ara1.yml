90#VERS#COMMENT##: The version I used for collation is a reprint by a
    different publisher. 2- All the biographical tags are added manually. 3-
    I showed the beginning of alphabetical letters with first-level blank
    headers. 4- Some of the entries are names, kunyas, laqabs or nisbas that
    signify more than one person. I also tagged them with ### $ as a
    simplified tag for dictionary items. 5- I deleted PageV01P192 which was
    duplicated. 6- The name of the editor in the METADATA is wrong. It is
    “منزوي”, not “فنروي”.
