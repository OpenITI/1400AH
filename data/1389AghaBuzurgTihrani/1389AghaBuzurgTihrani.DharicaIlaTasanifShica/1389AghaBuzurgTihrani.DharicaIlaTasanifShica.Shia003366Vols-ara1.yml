90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The tag “### $” is used as a simplified tag for book
    titles. It should ultimately be replaced by the complete form: ###
    $DIC_BIB$. 2- In addition to the name of the books that have numbers,
    there are cross references that do not have numbers. I tagged them with
    an asterisk (i.e. ### $ *) so that they are distinguishable. 3- Most of
    the second and third level headers are occasional. The problem with
    these occasional headers is that there is no subsequent header to show
    the end of the category under discussion. So, I added blank headers to
    show the change of subject. 4- I ran Peter’s script to check the numbers
    and corrected hundreds of numbers that were typed incorrectly. Some
    numbers still have problems. Some of them are duplicates and some others
    are missing. I showed the redundant and missing numbers by a plus (i.e.
    ### $ +) so that they are distinguishable. The point about them is that
    I checked all these incorrect numbers with the PDF and I must say they
    are all problems in the PDF, not the digital version which has a very
    high quality. Besides, the missing numbers in the PDF are just problems
    in numbering, because page numbers show that no information is missing.
    Actually now the digital version is better than the printed version
    since I corrected a lot of wrong numbers. I just showed the places of
    the numbers that are still incorrect by a plus sign. Ideally, they
    should be fixed in a newer edition and we don’t need to do anything
    about this (at this phase at least). 5- The only volume that categorizes
    the text according to the second alphabetical letter (i.e. “تد”, “تذ”,
    “تر” …) is the fourth volume. This type of categorization exists in a
    few cases in other volumes, but they are not consistent at all. So, I
    disregarded it in other volumes. 6- In volume 8, the editor of the text,
    “ع. منزوي”, who is the son of the writer, has added some explanations at
    the beginning of some sections and has added some unnumbered entries in
    these parts. I tagged such sections as editorial since they have not
    been written by the original author. However, I tagged the entries in
    such parts as a paragraph with two asterisks (i.e. # **) so that they
    are distinguishable. I’m not sure such editorial sections should be
    deleted as they provide further information about the main subject
    matter. 7- Footnotes appear just in volume 23. 8- In volume 24, “-&” or
    “-&gt” appear instead of the arrows in the text meaning “refer to”. 9-
    Volume 26 is “مستدركات المؤلف”, the newly-found pieces collected by the
    original author after publishing the text. In this volume, there is a
    redundant hashtag before each entry which must be deleted.
