90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH, PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The text was plain without any automatic tags. I
    tagged all the titles, but the verses of poems do not have any tag.
    2-Some parts have two successive titles. I put the second titles in
    parenthesis. 3- Page 115 is missing and page 117 is repeated in its
    place.
    PV: this text file was originally classified as written by Ibn 平Abd Rabbih, 
    but is in fact a modern selection of texts from his al-平Iqd al-Far朝d
    (see introduction, p. 7). The introduction is missing in the text file.
    The modern compiler (Sal朝m)'s contributions are marked as EDITORIAL here;
    I would leave them like that and not remove them. 
    NB: I can't observe the problem with p. 115; perhaps anothe page is meant by HRH?
